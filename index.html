                <!-- <p class='second-para'> So, of course I do love Anime. My favorite Anime of all time is "GHOST IN THE SHELL". This anime series are composed of 3 anime seasons (technically 5), 
                    2 animation movies, and latest short animation movie series (4 one hour movies). 
                    There's even its live-action movie HOLLYWOOD made, however, don't watch it.The movie is almost nothing to do with original Anime series, and it sucked. 
                    As a huge fun of Ghost In The Shell, I watched the movie at theater. Turns out, I was deeply disappointed and shamed that even the movie got title of Ghost In The Shell.</p>
