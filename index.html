        <p1 class="paragraph"> Hello everyone!! I am an internatinal business student at Mills College and also pursuing CS certificate simultaneously.
            I'm from Japan. So, of course I do love Anime. My favorite Anime of all the time is "GHOST IN THE SHELL". There's its movie HOLLYWOOD made, however, don't watch it.
        </p1>
            
        <p2 class="paragraph"> The movie is almost nothing to do with original Anime series, and it sucked. As a huge fun of Ghost In The Shell, I watched the movie at theater. Turns out, I was deeply disappointed and shamed that even 
            the movie got title of Ghost In The Shell.
        </p2>
       
        <p3 class="paragraph"> Anyway, my point is, I am a very friendly and kind person. </p3>
